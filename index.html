        <h1 style="font-size: 32px;">Introduction!</h1>
          <p><br>My name is Dylan Rohan, and you've stumbled across my sandbox.
            I am a knoweldge hungry Data Scientist eager to learn new skills. In an effort to deepen my understanding of of web design and cyber-secuirty, and data collection, I've taken steps to learn html, javascript and css. To gain a better understandong of version control, I've been regularly pushing updated code to github with git and storing this website on github. I've also taken short courses in SQL, databricks, and AWS to broarden my horizons and become better aquainted with big data tools.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 24px;"><br>Experience</h1>
            <P><br>I held a graduate data science position for around 9 months prior to leaving to support my wife with her work in Sydney. Now that I have completed my Masters in Data science I am looking for full time work. 
            
            <br><br>In my time as a graduate data scientist, I represented the entire data science team. The company was storing data on a shared excel document stored on onedrive, in some cases each day represented a new sheet in the document. I used ETL techniques to transfer data across to a secure database and constructed dashboards primarily through PowerBI. I also developed apps to ensure data integrity and accountability that also made recording tasks far simpler. The company had multiple teams, many of which were using different keywords to describe the same items, I unified the teams so they were all speaking in the same language. This enabled me to write a script that could more accurately report on stock movements from month to month (which I personally crosschecked with DroneDeploy).  I also assisted the Quality control team by connecting temperature sensors to a database and then prepared dashboards. I also automated warning messages to be sent through microsoft teams as an additional layer of security in case the sensors indicated a risk of fire. I also built an app that securely recorded all their Quality control data and pushed it to a dashboard. Towards the end of my time there, I began the construction of a database of all external transport movements with the end goal of improving vehicle utilization. 
            <br><br>
            Since then I have used my analytical skills as an operations manager for an Australian celebrity and their clothing line. In this position I have reduced tasks that once took hours into tasks that take at most 5 minutes. I have also been in charge of compiling social media data and providing the talent with advice, and preparing financial reports. 
            <br><br>
            I also have an extensive background as a communicator. I was a gymnastics coach at a Highett Youth Club for 5 years where I worked with participants of ages 0-65+ and participants and colleaguesx of all physical and mental abilities. I then spent another 3 years as both a tutor and science communicator, communicating with individuals as well as auditoriums of people in ways that made the complex more palatable. 
            </P>
